Some of his earliest memories are of hearing his dad sing songs by the Stanley Brothers and Bill Monroe and listening to Red Allen and Vern Williams on the stereo. Finnâ€™s musical journey formally 
          began at 3 when his dad took him to his first bluegrass festival in Grass Valley, CA. When he finally picked up an instrument at age 10, he Initially latched on to the guitar mastery of Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan. In high school Finn began to study the jazz playing of Stan Getz, Miles Davis, and Charlie Christian.

          Finn's academic journey took him to Bellingham, where he pursued environmental science at WWU. He simultaneously discovered a burgeoning bluegrass community in the Northwest, reigniting his interest in bluegrass music and the guitar playing of Tony Rice and David Grier. In 2019, he embraced the banjo, drawing inspiration from Bill Keith, JD Crowe, and Earl Scruggs.
